description: "Candida, a comedy by playwright George Bernard Shaw, was written in\
  \ 1894 and first published in 1898, as part of his Plays Pleasant. The central characters\
  \ are clergyman James Morell, his wife Candida and a youthful poet, Eugene Marchbanks,\
  \ who tries to win Candida's affections. The play questions Victorian notions of\
  \ love and marriage, asking what a woman really desires from her husband. The cleric\
  \ is a Christian Socialist, allowing Shaw—himself a Fabian Socialist—to weave political\
  \ issues, current at the time, into the story.\nShaw attempted but failed to have\
  \ a London production of the play put on in the 1890s, but there were two small\
  \ provincial productions. However, in late 1903 actor Arnold Daly had such a great\
  \ success with the play that Shaw would write by 1904 that New York was seeing \"\
  an outbreak of Candidamania\". The Royal Court Theatre in London performed the play\
  \ in six matinees in 1904. The same theatre staged several other of Shaw's plays\
  \ from 1904 to 1907, including further revivals of Candida.\n\n\n From Wikipedia\
